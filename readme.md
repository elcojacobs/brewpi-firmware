This repo is my personal remote to which I push work in progress for BrewPi/firmware.
This repo might be subject to rebases, amend commits and force pushing.

I do not recommend using any commit from this repo, use the official repository instead:
https://github.com/BrewPi/firmware

This repo is for work in progress, anything that is finished is pull requested against BrewPi/firmware and merged after code review.
